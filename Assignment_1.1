Problem Statements

1.	Say True or False for the below statements:
1.1	Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?
1.2	Base R packages installed automatically?

2.	What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
3.	Give an example of recycling of elements.


Solutions for the above Problem Statements

1.1 False
Reason:- Predective Analysis is used to predict the future outcomes.

1.2 True
Reason :- Base R packages installed automatically beause ther are builtin functions/packages that comes preinstalled in RStudio.

2.Recycling of elements in a vector occurs when vector arithmetic is performed on multiple vectors of different sizes 
i.e If two vectors are of unequal length, the shorter one will be recycled in order to match the longer vector.

3.For example, the following vectors x and y have unequal lengths, and their sum is computed by recycling values of the shorter vector u.
 x <- c(5,10,15)
 y <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
After Running in Rstudio Console
> x <- c(5,10,15)
> y <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
> z <- x+y
> z
[1]  6 12 18  9 15 21 12 18 24
