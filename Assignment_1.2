Problem Statement

1.	What should be the output of the following Script? 
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v%/%t)

2.	You have 25 excel files with names as xx_1.xlsx, xx_2.xlsx,â€¦	xx_25.xlsx in a dir.
Write a program to extract the contents of each excel sheet and make it one df.

3.	If the above 25 files were csv files, what would be your script to read?

Solutions

1.The Output will be :-
> v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
> t <- c(8, 3, 4)
> print(v%/%t)
[1] 0 1 1

In this script vector v is divided by t, the corresponding elements of the vectors will be divided and only the quotient will be shown
in the output i.e when we do 2/8=0.something or 5.5/3=1.something, thenit will show only the quotient part which is before the decimal part.
